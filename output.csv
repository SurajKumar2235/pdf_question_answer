The system can be published in the form of app or web pages and disseminated
through the Internet. The system can be installed and used on different devices, such
as computers, mobile phones, tablets, etc. It has good applicability. Through thisLHTsystem, autism can be diagnosed conveniently, and time can be saved for the early
treatment of autism patients, especially those in underdeveloped areas.
(2) It can make the diagnosis of autism more objective. The whole diagnosis process is
completed by the system. Because artificial intelligence technology is used to
recognize facial expressions without human intervention, the diagnosis results are
objective and accurate.

doctors to diagnose an autistic patient. By using this system, doctors can save a lot of
time and pay attention to the treatment of autism.","technology to extract facial expression response feature vectors and use artificial intelligence
technology to distinguish normal group and autistic group based on these facial features.
3.2.2 The principle of diagnosing autism through facial expressions. A large number of
studies have pointed out that autistic patients have deficiencies in facial expression
recognition and understanding. This is the core source of impaired social function in
autistic patients ( Yang et al. , 2017 ). Autistic children are more difficult to identify other
people ’s emotional behavior, and it is difficult to make appropriate judgment and responseLHT(Shen et al. , 2013 ). Overseas research on facial expression recognition ability of autistic
patients has been carried out not only in children but also in adults. Most studies believe that
the ability of facial expression recognition of autistic patients is low. Baron-Cohen et al. (1997)","education of autistic children. At the same time, autism also brings high subjective load and
depression to the families of patients, which has a negative impact on their quality of life
(Singh et al., 2017 ;Wang et al., 2018 ). It can be seen that the incidence of autism in children is
relatively serious, and the harm to society and family is enormous.
3.2 Diagnosis of autism through facial expressions
3.2.1 Facial expression recognition disorder. Autistic children have facial expression
recognition obstacles, which are mainly manifested in their inability to recognize facial
expressions ( Liuet al., 2015 ). It is easy to distinguish autistic children from normal children by
observing their facial expressions. Therefore, we combine facial expression recognition
technology to extract facial expression response feature vectors and use artificial intelligence
technology to distinguish normal group and autistic group based on these facial features.","testers, the recognition rate of the system is 81.4 percent. It can effectively distinguish
whether the expression of children is normal or not. It provides a practical information system
for the diagnosis of autism. This paper will continue to collect more children ’s facial
expression data from different countries and regions as training samples to further improve
the recognition rate of facial expressions.
The autism diagnosis information system designed in this study has the following
important significance:
(1) Autism can be diagnosed as early as possible by using this system. The best time to
treat autism is before the age of six. The earlier the diagnosis of autism is made, the
less the treatment cost and the higher the probability of recovery. Early diagnosis is
of great value in alleviating the burden on families and society of autistic patients.

3.1 Autism and its development
Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder, which is collectively referred to as autism
spectrum disorder ( Duan et al., 2015 ).
Since Kanner, an American child psychiatrist, first reported autism in 1943, the incidence
of autism has risen rapidly worldwide. In the 1980s, about 3 –5 out of every 10,000 people
suffered from the disease, while in 2000, 6.7 out of every 1,000 children suffered from the
disease ( Vismara and Rogers, 2008 ). According to the National Center for Health Statistics,
the probability of autism among children aged 3 –14 in the United States reached 2.76 percent
in 2016 ( Zablotsky et al., 2017 ).
There is no statistical survey on autistic children in China. However, according to the data","After consulting a large number of literatures and investigating the actual situation of the

There is no statistical survey on autistic children in China. However, according to the data","increase the recognition of children ’s physical movement and realize the diagnosis of autism
from multiple perspectives.
Because the average age of children using and collecting facial expression data is between
3 and 8 years old, the system can recognize children aged 3 –6 years old. Therefore, through
this system, autism can be diagnosed as soon as possible. The earlier the diagnosis and
treatment of autism is, the better the rehabilitation effect. Therefore, it is of great significance
for the treatment of autism.
Because the training samples of the system adopt the international open facial expression
database, which contains the facial expression data of children and adults in different
countries and regions, the system can diagnose autism for children and adults in different
countries and regions.
Of course, the system also needs to be improved through practical use. Next, we will

the ability of facial expression recognition of autistic patients is low. Baron-Cohen et al. (1997)
used standard facial expression maps to study the recognition of different emotional types in
autistic adults. It was found that autistic adults had better recognition of some basic facial
expressions, such as happiness, but relatively complex facial expressions such as surprise
recognition were difficult to recognize.
At present, the main diagnostic criteria of autism are: IDC-10, DSM-IV, the autism child
behavior scale (ABC), the children autism rating scale (CARS) and the Clancy behavior scale
(CABS) ( Wang, 2007 ).
After consulting a large number of literatures and investigating the actual situation of the

others. Fifteen items of the CARS scale, the third of which is emotional response, pleasure and
unhappiness and interest, are expressed by changes in facial expression and posture. These
scales basically include the items of autism detection by children ’s facial expressions, which
show that the diagnosis of autism can be more accurate by facial expressions. With the
progress of artificial intelligence technology, facial expression recognition technology can
objectively and effectively reflect the mental health of children and can be used in early
diagnosis of autism ( Yanbin et al., 2018 ).
We also communicated with doctors of Hubei Maternal and Child Health Hospital, Wuhan
Children ’s Hospital and Guangzhou Women and Children ’s Medical Center many times, and
actually checked the process of using the above autism diagnostic scale to diagnose children."

arrange for the system to be tested in a large number of cooperative hospitals. Next, there are","testers, the recognition rate of the system is 81.4 percent. It can effectively distinguish
whether the expression of children is normal or not. It provides a practical information system
for the diagnosis of autism. This paper will continue to collect more children ’s facial
expression data from different countries and regions as training samples to further improve
the recognition rate of facial expressions.
The autism diagnosis information system designed in this study has the following
important significance:
(1) Autism can be diagnosed as early as possible by using this system. The best time to
treat autism is before the age of six. The earlier the diagnosis of autism is made, the
less the treatment cost and the higher the probability of recovery. Early diagnosis is
of great value in alleviating the burden on families and society of autistic patients.
The system can be published in the form of app or web pages and disseminated","The main symptoms of autism include impaired social and interpersonal communication,
language retardation, repetitive behavior and sensory dysfunction. It is difficult for autistic
patients to correctly recognize faces and explain facial emotions. They have different
emotional expressions from ordinary people, and they cannot correctly perceive and
understand some basic expressions such as anger ( Yan, 2008 ).
At present, the diagnostic methods for autism spectrum disorders include: traditional
standard DSM-IV-TR ( Segal, 2010 ) and ICD-10 ( Organization W H, 1992 ), various autism
diagnostic assessment scales such as “Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) ”,“the autism
child behavior scale (ABC) ”and autism behavior rating scale and questionnaire interviews
(Wang and Lu, 2015 ). Most of these methods rely on doctors ’direct observation of the
patient ’s expression, speech and behavior based on their experience. Diagnostic results are","an important role in the prevention and diagnosis of diseases. For example, this article is to
diagnose autism by analyzing children ’s facial expressions.

Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder, which is collectively referred to as autism
spectrum disorder ( Duan et al., 2015 ).
Since Kanner, an American child psychiatrist, first reported autism in 1943, the incidence
of autism has risen rapidly worldwide. In the 1980s, about 3 –5 out of every 10,000 people
suffered from the disease, while in 2000, 6.7 out of every 1,000 children suffered from the
disease ( Vismara and Rogers, 2008 ). According to the National Center for Health Statistics,
the probability of autism among children aged 3 –14 in the United States reached 2.76 percent
in 2016 ( Zablotsky et al., 2017 ).

expressions, such as happiness, but relatively complex facial expressions such as surprise
recognition were difficult to recognize.
